This feeling has already been the culprit of lots of frustration in hindsight, since it’s no secret, that in order to be good at something, you have to spend time doing that something, but if you keep jumping from thing to thing, you end up not spending enough time.</p>\n<p>Even when my situation involves non-optimal use of my time, I’m still pretty happy with the results. Getting piqued by interest is far more preferable than the other extreme, in my opinion.</p>\n<p>My experience at my last project taught me how important is to <strong>know stuff deeply</strong>, which is something I’m not very used to do, since I have that strong desire to get things to work ASAP. Silly me, more often than not, a relatively small expenditure of time can lead to astronomical savings.</p>\n<p>Take for instance learning about <strong>frontend development</strong>. It’s a mess. It’s even more of a mess if you enter a new project in which webpack, makefiles, docker, regression tests, and possibly many others are configured.</p>\n<p>In order for you to make improvements, you really need to get a broad overview picture of what each piece does in your system. Yes, webpack allows you to use JSX, makefiles will run common combination of various scripts (usually, in turn, running npm scripts), docker runs a virtual machine, and the tests you know, test.</p>\n<p>That shallow understanding of each of the tools can lead to problems. Investing in learning those, be it at least to demystify them, can be a huge conceptual saver, and can help you to know that <strong>nothing is magic</strong>, for anything that happens, there is code there (or well, unlucky you if your hardware was the one to fail you).</p>\n<h2>Closing Remarks</h2>\n<p>Code is hard, give it time. Experience is invaluable. Have a clear understanding of what your tools are doing in your development process. Have fun.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"New Beginnings","date":"October 15, 2020","description":"Nothing as exciting as getting a new book or project to start working on."}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/my-second-post/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My Second Post!"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"d1f08907-5cad-5d70-95c2-77cc9cef288f","previousPostId":"b9f504e0-7210-5df2-8fa9-6d4615e677c8","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","916993862"]}
